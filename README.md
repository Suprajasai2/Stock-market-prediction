# Stock-market-prediction

A correct prediction of stocks can lead to huge profits for the seller and the broker. Frequently, it is brought out that prediction is chaotic rather than random, which means it can be predicted by carefully analyzing the history of respective stock market. Machine learning is an efficient way to represent such processes. It predicts a market value close to the tangible value, thereby increasing the accuracy. Introduction of machine learning to the area of stock prediction has appealed to many researches because of its efficient and accurate measurements. Regression and LSTM models are engaged for this conjecture separately. Regression involves minimizing error and LSTM contributes to remembering the data and results for the long run. 

# Data Set

The vital part of machine learning is the dataset used. The dataset should be as concrete as possible because a little change in the data can perpetuate massive changes in the outcome. In this project, supervised machine learning is employed on a dataset obtained from Yahoo Finance. This dataset comprises of following five variables: open, close, low, high and volume. Open, close, low and high are different bid prices for the stock at separate times with nearly direct names. The volume is the number of shares that passed from one owner to another during the time period. The model is then tested on the test data.
